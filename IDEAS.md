# Card Stages

Like in Anki. New, learning, mature, with a state machine.

Arguably, the first time a card is reviewed, "forgetting" should not adjust the FSRS parameters.

# Term-Definition Cards

A shorthand. Writing:

```
T: lithification
D: The process of turning loose sediment into rock.
```

Is equivalent to writing this:

```
Q: Define: lithification
A: The process of turning loose sediment into rock.

Q: Term for: The process of turning loose sediment into rock.
A: lithification
```
